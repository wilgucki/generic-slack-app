# Generic Slack App

This is Slack app template I'm using for building Slack apps/bots.

Generic Slack App uses AWS Lambda as a handler and API Gateway to route request to that
handler.

There's still lot to do, e.g. tests, credentials storage, etc. I would not consider this
project as production ready, nor should you.
